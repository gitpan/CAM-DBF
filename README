DESCRIPTION

This package facilitates reading and writing dBASE III PLUS DBF files.
This is made possible by documentation generously released by Borland
at http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,15838,00.html

Currently, only version III PLUS files are readable.  This module does
not support dBASE version IV or 5.0 files.  See XBase for better
support.
