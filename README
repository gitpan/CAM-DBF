DESCRIPTION

This package facilitates reading dBASE III PLUS DBF files.  This is
made possible by documentation generously released by Borland at:

  http://community.borland.com/article/0%2C1410%2C15838%2C00.html

Currently, only version III PLUS files are readable.  Support has not
yet been added for dBASE version IV or 5.0 files.

This library also supports writing dBASE files, but the writing
interface is not as polished as the reading interface.
